# Data analysis of the Prescribed Optimism experiment replication


This is the data analysis, visualization and statistical hypothesis testing of the data collected by an online survey, in the context of the Research Methodologies course.
See documentation at the full project [repository](https://github.com/jansensan/prescribed-optimism-questionnaire.git).

The project was about the replication of the experiment conducted by [Armor, Massey & Sackett (2008)](https://ir.stthomas.edu/ocbmktgpub/27/) and  later reproduced by 
[Lassetter, Brandt & van 't Veer (2016)](https://osf.io/qlzap/), taken from the the Reproducibility Project of the Open Science Framework.

The original result was replicated with statistical significance, as data shows that participants thought it is better to make optimistically biased predictions than accurate or pessimistically biased ones.
